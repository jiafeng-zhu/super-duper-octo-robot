Hello! My name is Jiafeng Zhu. You can just call me Feng.
I am from Shanghai, China and currently pursuing a MDes/HCI at IIT Institute of Design in Chicago.
I am a Product Designer with a background in Industrial Design, creating experience that resonates with people. I enjoy breaking down complex problems with an eye for details and balancing usability and emotional care in design.
My interest lies in exploring human-product interaction patterns that can influence user's behavior and create better using experience from both physical and psychological levels.
